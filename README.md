# cyberServer
a product used by cyberServer

This project use mysql as the database,but in the future version,i will change to sql server.

This project also have a tiny httpServer,but only with limit functions,in the future i will instead it by a more functional httpServer.

This project only has the server part,we also need the client part and the cashier part to make it useful to the cybercoffee.In the future if i have the time,i will do it.

This project now is only available for the single cybercaffe,if you want use it in a chain of cybercoffes,sorry,you have to modify yourself,mybe in the futuer,i will provide this function if i have enough time.But donot trust me.


But recently,i have to prepare for the ielts exam and i am still at work,so i really have little time to maintain this project.
In the future,if i have a good score in the exam of ielts and get the Canada study visa,maybe i will allocate more time on this project.
